Title: How can I submit attachments to papers?
weight: 2
---

To submit paper attachments, use [this Microsoft form](https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=DQSIkWdsW0yxEjajBLZtrQAAAAAAAAAAAAMAABqTSThUN0I2VEdZMTk4Sks3S042MVkxUEZQUVdOUS4u).
**Please note**: If the file attachment cannot be downloaded automatically (via `wget`), processing of your attachment will fail.

Attachments are processed at least quarterly, at the beginning of January, April, July, and October.
Additional processing is undertaken as volunteer time permits.
