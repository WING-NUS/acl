Title: How can I submit corrections to papers?
weight: 1
---

For corrections to *metadata only* (meaning that no change to the PDF is required), please file [a Github issue](https://github.com/acl-org/acl-anthology/issues/new).
**Be sure to indicate the Anthology ID of the paper** (e.g., P19-1017).
Metadata changes are generally accepted if they comport with the PDF, which we take as authoritative.

If you need to make changes to the *content*, the Anthology can process either an *erratum* or a *revision*.
More information on this [can be found here]({{< relref "/info/corrections.md" >}}).
In short, you will use [this Microsoft Form](https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=DQSIkWdsW0yxEjajBLZtrQAAAAAAAAAAAAMAABqTSThUN0I2VEdZMTk4Sks3S042MVkxUEZQUVdOUS4u).
Please note the following:

- The PDF you submit needs to be retrievable via `wget`.
- You need to provide a summary of the changes.
  This summary will be included in the Anthology, and should be written from a neutral,  scientific perspective.

These conditions help us to process corrections more quickly.
We will do our best to process corrections within six weeks, but do not make guarantees as to the processing time.
Submissions not meeting these standards will be rejected, potentially without notice.
