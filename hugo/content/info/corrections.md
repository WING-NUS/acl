### Types of corrections

The staff of the ACL Anthology can process requests for both many types of corrections to data in the ACL Anthology.
These include correcting *metadata* and posting *errata* and *revisions* for scholarly works that are already published.
While this service can help correct post-publication problems, due to certain difficulties and liabilities, the corrections have certain limitations, which we describe here.

+ Corrections to **Metadata** do not require the submission of a new PDF.
+ An ***Erratum*** clarifies errors made in the original scholarly work. Usually
  these are just short notes, correcting statements, equations or other problems
  in the original, and needs to be read with the original work.
+ A ***Revision*** is a replacement to the original scholarly work (take note of
  the caveat below). This format allows a correction to be read independently of
  the original scholarly work, but does not call highlight where the original
  has errors.

Please take note of the following before requesting either service:

+ The **original published version is not invalidated** by either service. The
  original will still stand as published and cannot be withdrawn, and both the
  original version and its revision will remain available and linked on the
  website.
+ The metadata page for the work and any indexing listing or search result will
  indicate the availability of an erratum or a revision.
+ Any accompanying full volumes will not be retrofitted with either revisions or
  errata.
+ If possible, when generating your revision, it would be good to add the proper proceedings header and footer stamps, as well as the page numbering.
  Unfortunately, we cannot provide any assistance with this task.
+ Requests to change the metadata of a work can be accommodated. If the metadata
  changes impact the work's physical form (e.g., adding an additional author), a
  revision must also be supplied.
+ Downstream consumers of the Anthology are typically notified of the change in
  your work's manifestation, but there are no guarantees that those services
  (e.g., search engines) will update their information.

### Filing Corrections

For requests to change paper *metadata* (that do not require any PDF changes), please file [a Github issue](https://github.com/acl-org/acl-anthology/issues/new).
**Be sure to indicate the Anthology ID of the paper** (e.g., P19-1017).
If you are savvy, you could correct the data yourself in our [authoritative XML files](https://github.com/acl-org/acl-anthology/tree/master/data/xml) and issue a pull request.
This will expedite the processing of your request.

To request a revision or erratum, [please use this form](https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=DQSIkWdsW0yxEjajBLZtrQAAAAAAAAAAAAMAABqTSThUN0I2VEdZMTk4Sks3S042MVkxUEZQUVdOUS4u).
For revisions, you will need to provide a paragraph-form summary of all the changes in the revision.
This description will be published together with your revision and should be written in a neutral scientific tone.
**Please ensure** that the link you provide is *directly* to a downloadable PDF that works with `wget`.
Anthology staff will respond to your request as time permits.
