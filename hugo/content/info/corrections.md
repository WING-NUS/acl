Title: Requesting Corrections

The staff of the ACL Anthology can process requests for both *errata* and
*revisions* for scholarly works that are already published. These are processed
at a lower priority than normal ingestion, maintenance, and development work for
the Anthology, but will be processed in due course. While this service can help
correct post-publication problems, due to certain difficulties and liabilities,
the corrections have certain limitations, which we describe here. **It is
strongly recommended to ensure your work is correct when published.**

+ An ***Erratum*** clarifies errors made in the original scholarly work. Usually
  these are just short notes, correcting statements, equations or other problems
  in the original, and needs to be read with the original work.
+ A ***Revision*** is a replacement to the original scholarly work (take note of
  the caveat below). This format allows a correction to be read independently of
  the original scholarly work, but does not call highlight where the original
  has errors.

Please take note of the following before requesting either service:

+ The **original published version is not invalidated** by either service. The
  original will still stand as published and cannot be withdrawn, and both the
  original version and its revision will remain available and linked on the
  website.
+ When using the ACL Anthology URL assigned to resolve the document, the revised will be returned.
+ The metadata page for the work and any indexing listing or search result will
  indicate the availability of an erratum or a revision.
+ If the original work needs to be invalidated, we need to issue a retraction, a
  statement that replaces the original work's PDF. This is a drastic measure
  that may have legal repercussions, and should be avoided whenever
  possible. You must inform your proceedings and general chair of the hosting
  event, or journal editor-in-chief, before attempting to issue a retraction.
+ Any accompanying full volumes will not be retrofitted with either revisions or
  errata. Similarly, you do not need to provide the proper footers or headers
  for either revisions or errata. It is still recommended that you keep page
  numberings of the original work, where possible.
+ Requests to change the metadata of a work can be accommodated. If the metadata
  changes impact the work's physical form (e.g., adding an additional author), a
  revision must also be supplied.
+ Downstream consumers of the Anthology are typically notified of the change in
  your work's manifestation, but there are no guarantees that those services
  (e.g., search engines) will update their particulars.

### Filing Corrections

To request a correction, [file an issue on our Github
repository](https://github.com/acl-org/acl-anthology/issues/new?assignees=&labels=correction&template=correction.md&title=Correction). Please
be sure to follow the instructions in [the issue
template](https://github.com/acl-org/acl-anthology/issues/new?assignees=&labels=correction&template=correction.md&title=Correction). In
particular, it is important to include the ACL Anthology ID (e.g., P00-1001) of
the work you are referring to. If you are posting a revised PDF or erratum, you
can attach it to the issue. Anthology staff will respond to your request in due
time.
